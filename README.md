# Impacts on Society

## Course Description:

AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP) is one of the newest AP courses from the College Board.  AP CSP introduces students to the foundational concepts of computer science and explores the impact computing and technology have on our society. There are no official prerequisites (C or better is IM1/Algebra 1 recommended) and the course is meant to be a first-time introduction to computer science, but students should be comfortable with functions and function notation. AP CSP is a year-long high school curriculum that fully addresses the five “Big Ideas” of computer science and six “Computational Thinking Practices,” as specified by the College Board’s AP Computer Science Principles curriculum framework. In addition, the CodeHS platform (and related courses) are well aligned with California Computer Science Standards and Standards Framework, Common Core Math Standards, and Next Generation Science Standards most notably. 

The lessons and materials used throughout this curriculum incorporate Project-Based Learning (PBL), a pedagogical approach that actively engages students in the educational process, improves retention, and develops problem-solving, critical-thinking, and group communication skills. Through this collaborative, learner-centric approach, students are encouraged to explore the advantages and societal impact of computational technology while developing their own programming and computational thinking skills.

## Impacts Plan Preamble (Mindset):

To stay on brand with  the PBL pedagogical approach, a colleague and I have come up with a four-part lesson series meant to be used near the end of the first, second, third, fourth quarter of this year-long course. To address the increasing complex idea of computing impacts on society, the plan is as follows:

<ol>
  <li>Having them grapple with ideas and situations where there is no clear “good” or “bad” but instead a muddied middle ground.</li>
  <li>Have the students take note of technology’s impacts on their own lives.</li>
  <li>Have the students contemplate the impacts of popular technologies on the public in general.</li>
  <li>Finally, ask students to address this final, synthesis question, “Are there any computing technology we, as a society, would be better off without?”</li>
</ol>

As a final note, instructors should keep in mind that this lesson series will be informed by [Webb’s Depth of Knowledge](https://www.synergiseducation.com/blooms-taxonomy-and-webbs-depth-of-knowledge/#:~:text=Webb%27s%20Depth%20of%20Knowledge%20(DoK,level%20of%20complexity%20in%20thinking.) (DoK) and is meant to move in order from DoK 1 to DoK 4. That is to say, move from less complex ideas and rigor to more complex and synthesis of ideas. Be aware that the following plan (and associated parts) would benefit greatly from individual lesson plans detailing granular teacher moves intended to help students wade through these intricate ideas.

## Plan



### Part 1

#### Learning Objectives

Students are able to articulate and argue which person they support from the video. The overall thought is to first have students analyze others behaviors before turning the analysis to themselves and society as a whole (Parts 2 - 4) 

#### Learning Activities

Watch video ([Lesson Video: One Piece ep.249](https://www.crunchyroll.com/watch/GRX0MNV36/spandams-scheme-the-day-the-sea-train-shook))
<li>Start at 5:50 and watch until 22:05</li>

#### Assessment

Students will engage in small group discussion, class discussion, and perform a quick write about their observations and analysis. Quick write will be collected and read for “honest effort” to grapple and argue with the question(s) presented.

### Part 2

#### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to create a list of technology that impacts their lives and can argue if the impact is positive, negative, or neutral. 

#### Learning Activities

Students will be asked to create a technology log (much like a food nutrition log) to log which apps/technologies they use and for how long.

#### Assessment

Students will be asked to reflect on whether they think their own technological habits need adjustment, if so then will be asked to create a “Diet Plan” to help themselves cut back. If they deem they do not have an issue with technology in their lives, they will need to argue how their relationship with technology is healthy

### Part 3

#### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to look at societally accepted apps/technologies and decide if those apps/technologies have positive, negative, or neutral impact on society\.

#### Learning Activities

Students will work in small groups to identify and list examples of computing technologies that have impacted society (on a larger scale), then investigate how those technologies have specifically impacted society. (Left vague on purpose, students must decide if the technologies have positive, negative, or neutral impact on society)

#### Assessment

Students will be asked to create a poster describing the computing technology they chose and how the technology they chose impacted society.

### Part 4

#### Learning Objectives

Given all of their prior work and evidence students will be asked to answer, “Are there any computing technology we, as a society, would be better off without?”

#### Learning Activities

To assist students in coming to their conclusion instructor may want to provide additional prompts such as:
<li>Do positive aspects outweigh negative aspects?</li>
<li>Can we realistically control who or what is invented? Can we actually limit innovation?</li>
<li>Are there certain technologies we would be better off without today?</li>

#### Assessment

Students will have answered the Objective question with a thorough, thoughtful, complete response.

### Outcomes

The primary goal of this Impacts Plan is not to have a “right” or “correct” answer but to simply get students to think deeply about the technology they currently or may interact with in their lives. To this end, this plan was meant to help shift a students mindset from that of a consumer technology to that of a producer of technology. The focus is not specificity of technology, but of its broader impacts it has on our lives.

A strength of this lesson series specifically, is its broad approach to the topic of computing technologies impact. With such a broad approach, students will be able to engage with the prompts by looking at technology that is specifically relevant and important to them. Simultaneously, this will increase exposure to different types of computing technologies, literally diversifying the conversation around the impacts technology, as a broad idea, has on people's lives. 

Finally, this lesson series helps show students how to be more active consumers or more cognizant producers of technology. Our students will now consider the possible negative ramifications of how one may potentially try to exploit their product. This lesson series showed students that even if we may not be able to see any downsides to something we create, that doesn’t mean there are not any. Additionally, students will better understand that there is no controlling innovation, people will always push the boundary of what is acceptable or “right”.
